I attended Coding Dojo bootcamp. I think it was one of the greatest life decisions I could have made. If you are thinking about whether you should attend one or not, my short answer to you would be, YES. Not everyone can attend one or has the opportunity to attend one but if that opportunity presents itself, I say take that as soon as you can. If you put in the work it will change your life.

## A little about my story

After graduating high school I knew that I did not want to go to college right away. It just wasn't something that I was interested in at the time. what I had wanted to do was join the army and do something bigger than just myself. I decided to join the army and become an Army Ranger where I served for about 5 years.

When my time came to leave the military, I tried to pursue something that I enjoyed doing and that was carpentry. I had a lot of fun building custom RVs and toy haulers but very quickly realized that that wasn't where I wanted to spend the rest of my life.

I decided to leave that position and take a risk.

I joined Coding Dojo and 3 months after graduating got a job as a Software Developer Consultant and nearly tripled my salary at my manual labor job. Life was finally headed in the right direction.

## How much will it cost?

This depends on a couple of factors. That ranges from which one you attend to even your veteran status. I had originally wanted to attend CodingDojo 2 years ago but at the time I was at my carpenter job and told myself I couldn't afford it because for me to attend I also would have to move to one of their locations. Fast forward to mid-Covid times and I found out that they transitioned to online. I suddenly got very interested again and once I found out the G.I.Bill would cover the costs, my decision had been made, I was going to attend Coding Dojo.

I would recommend looking at all sorts of options when it comes to financing. I know a few people that were in the bootcamp with me and they told me that they benefited greatly from the great financing options that Coding Dojo offers. I mean down the road you will be making more anyway so it really could pay for itself.

## Guarantee you a job?

I also get people asking me If attending a Bootcamp guarantees you a job. I would say that nothing can guarantee you a job. But what the bootcamp can do is give you all the knowledge you need to greatly increase your chances of getting a job and make you stand out over other job candidates.

CodingDojo offers "Career Services" which again is something that I would highly recommend. They pair you with a career advisor and their main focus is to set you up to get a job. That being said they are not just going to give you a company name and say here's a job. It was a process, they help you set up your portfolio, Github, LinkedIn, and anything else that might be beneficial to your job search.

The career advisor that I was paired with was awesome. He taught me what it was that recruiters would be looking for. He recommended how I search for potential jobs, not just going to Indeed or another job board and searching for "developer". Taking all the advice that was given to me and applying that information is what I say increased my chances of getting that job.

## How to get the most out of it

If I had to sum this whole section up using one word it would be, participate. Coding Dojo had a lot of hands-on learning and group work to do every day. From what I have seen, the people that participated in those have a job in the industry now. That means if the instructor asks a question, don't be afraid to answer. Even if it is wrong, they won't laugh at you, they will teach you how to be right.

There was also time each day that we were free to work on the assignments that were due the next day and you could work on those however you wanted. What I recommend is getting together with other students and working together. I would be in a voice call every day with 4-5 people and if we had a question, we could all ask each other and all learn at the same time. So many times I saw people not engaging in those group calls and when the exam day came around they were a lot more lost than the ones that were.

When project week comes around you can also work together on those projects and start learning how to work on a team. I enjoyed doing this because something that helps in the job search is having projects to show. So if you work on a team and coming out of the bootcamp you have some projects to show, that is already a good starting point. Then once you are done with the bootcamp you have more time to polish up your projects and work on your portfolio from there and lock that job in.

## Conclusion

To sum it all up, if you can attend a coding bootcamp I say do it. I would recommend Coding Dojo just because of how great my experience was there. Once you are in a bootcamp, engage and put in the extra work each day and you will succeed. When the workday is over, keep going. Join that bootcamp you want and finally get that dream job and lifestyle that you want.
